Please note that all plotted values are five-year estimates.

$\bf{Median ~ Annual ~ Household ~ Income:}$ This includes the income of the household and all other individuals ages 15 and over. Median annual household income is adjusted to the 2015 $\$$ and provides a clear trend to assess residents' household income overtime. Annual data for median annual household income was collected for a ten-year time series, from 2002- 2012, the latest data available. Data was collected at multiple levels to allow for analysis at multiple levels; municipality, state, and US level comparatively.


$\bf{Median:}$ The median divides the distribution of median annual household income into two equal parts; half that fall below the median for median annual household income and half that fall above the median annual household income.


$\bf{Five-Year ~ Estimate:}$ Survey information is collected everyday of the year and then aggregated over a specific time period, five years. Multiyear estimates are available to regions with populations less than 65,000. However, more precise estimates are possible with larger geographic regions. To analyze change over time, users are discouraged from utilizing overlapping multi-year estimates (e.g. 2005-2009, 2006-2010) due to the inability to isolate change with precision.

Please note that all plotted values are five-year estimates.

$\bf{Poverty ~ Status:}$ To determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person's total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition. If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered below the poverty level. Poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder.


$\bf{Poverty ~ Threshold:}$ Poverty thresholds are determined by multiplying base year thresholds (set as yearly income in 1982) by the monthly inflation factor for the 12 months before the period of interest. For example, if we want to determine if a family with three children with a total income of $\$14,000$ (July 2012 - June 2013) was at or below the poverty threshold we would do the following. First we would see what the base year threshold was in 1982 for a family of this size, $\$7,765$. We then multiply this by the inflation rate for the 12-month period before June 2012 - July 2013, which is 2.39719. This would give us a threshold income of $\$18,614$. When we compare this to the income of the family above, $\$14,000$ is well below the threshold we calculated, meaning this family would be considered to be in poverty. In this graph, we calculate the poverty threshold as described in the example above as being $\$23,268$.

Multiyear estimates are available to regions with populations less than 65,000. However, more precise estimates are possible with larger geographic regions.

$\bf{Average ~ Monthly ~ Employment:}$ To estimate monthly employment, all employees who were paid at any point in the past year are counted (this includes full-time, part-time, seasonal, salaried, and hourly employees). The total number of employees is then divided by the number of pay periods per calendar year at each business establishment.

$\bf{Unemployment ~ Rate:}$ The unemployment rate is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which uses state and national level information from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Municipality unemployment rates were gathered form a section of the BLS and CPS called the Local Areas Unemployment Statistics Series. The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed people as a proportion of the total labor force. For example, if the civilian labor force equals 100 people and 7 people are unemployed, then the unemployment rate would be 7 percent.

$\bf{Business ~ Bankruptcy:}$ Any bankruptcy filed by a business, corporation, or professional partnership.

$\bf{Chapter ~ 7:}$ This chapter deals with liquidation, the sale of a debtor's nonexempt property and the distribution of the funds to the creditors. In order to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy a debtor must pass a 'means test' given by the court, which evaluates their income and expenses. Depending on the nature of the debt, both individuals and businesses may file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.


$\bf{Chapter ~ 11:}$ This chapter deals with corporations or partnerships. In order to file a chapter 11 bankruptcy a corporation must propose a restructuring plan which keeps the business alive by repaying debt over time.


$\bf{Chapter ~ 12:}$ This chapter deals with the debt of a family farmer or family fisherman. It allows them to create a payment plan to pay back their debt over the course of three to five years, if they can prove regular annual income.


$\bf{Chapter ~ 13:}$ This chapter deals with the debt of an individual. It allows them to create a payment plan to pay back their debt over the course of three to five years, if they can prove regular annual income.
