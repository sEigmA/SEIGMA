Please note that all plotted values are five-year estimates.

$\bf{Age:}$ The number of people within each age group, for a region over a specified five year range. Age groups were specified in the dataset as <5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+. For this app, the number of categories for age has been collapsed to the following six groups: <20, 20-34, 35-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+. This is done in order to simplify the presentation of data. 

$\bf{Five-Year ~ Estimate:}$ Survey information is collected everyday of the year and then aggregated over a specific time period, five years. Multiyear estimates are available to regions with populations less than 65,000. However, more precise estimates are possible with larger geographic regions. To analyze change over time, users are discouraged from utilizing overlapping multi-year estimates (e.g. 2005-2009, 2006-2010) due to the inability to isolate change with precision.

$\bf{Race:}$ The number of people within each race, for a region over a specified five year range. Races were listed as White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or some other race. Within the Map tab race categories are listed here as White, Black, and Asian. Although the data for other races is available, the percentage is too small to depict in map format accurately. To view the percentage of other race categories please refer to the Plot or Summary tabs.
